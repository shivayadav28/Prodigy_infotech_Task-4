# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Twitter data to classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. The notebook provides an end-to-end solution for processing raw text data, performing sentiment analysis, and visualizing the results. This work was developed as part of the Prodigy Infotech Internship, showcasing data science and machine learning techniques applied to real-world text data.

# Project Workflow
# 1. Dataset Description

**Source:** Twitter API or a preprocessed dataset.

**Content:** Tweets and associated sentiment labels.

# Key variables include:
**Text:** The tweet content.

**Sentiment:** Label indicating positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

# 2. Data Preprocessing

Cleaning raw text data, including:
Removing special characters, URLs, and mentions.
Tokenization and lemmatization.
Handling missing values and duplicates.

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Analyzing sentiment distribution.**

**Visualizing tweet length, word frequency, and other text features.**

# 4. Modeling

**Implementing machine learning models for sentiment classification:**
